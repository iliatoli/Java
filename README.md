# Java
Everything for my Java class at CSUG.

I have a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Pisa, Italy; a Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Central Florida; an M.S. in aerospace engineering from the San Jose State University, California. I am studying for a B.S. in computer science at Colorado State University Global. I have mid-junior standing at this moment. I am also a senior with a B.S. in psychology at the University of Central Florida. It is unclear whether I will finish either of the two B.S. degrees. Sometimes I regret the degrees that I have.

I also speak five languages: English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Albanian. I spoke Russian before, but it has been too many years that I do not use it anymore. I do not regret not maintaining it.

Currently, I work as a mechanical engineer at a company in Houston, Texas. I have worked as a lecturer of mathematics, chemistry, and aerospace engineering at undergraduate and graduate levels at various US universities in the years 2007 -- 2023. It is a beautiful profession but it pays way too poorly.
